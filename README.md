# DefinabilityTheory_Z3_lib
Coursework 2025 by Kirill Dik

The library is designed to check, whether Relation R is between two other Relations or not.

Note 1: there are two different class groups, reperesenting the relations in <Z, +1> and <Z^2, +(0,1), +(1,0)>.
Note 2: Programm does not always give a definitive answer, and the calculations may take a while.

The z3 installation is required for the lib work. See CMakeLists.txt to see dependency.
